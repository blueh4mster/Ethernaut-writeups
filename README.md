# Ethernaut-writeups
This repository is a collection of my writeups for [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges. I've tried them recently and I am only a beginner and I wanted to share my take on these challenges.

>The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players.

Ethernaut consists of many challenges related to smart contract security essentially focused on the Ethereum Blockchain. It is a fun way to learn various concepts of smart contract security and learn about Blockchains as well. Some of the challenges also include real world threats to smart contracts and how malicious individuals can exploit vulnerable smart contracts. 

At the end of each challenge, we must also pay attention to how we can avoid malicious attacks and exploits.

The wargame runs on testnets and you can interact with it through Web3js and Metamask. Instruction on how to start can be found [here](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/help). [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser-based Ethereum wallet. [Web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) is a Javascript API for the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the player to interact with the blockchain via the browser console.
